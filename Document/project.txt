Project Name - Share-Steer Ride Sharing App

Scope -

The scope of our project is to build an app which will allow the car owner to publish a ride and passenger to search for a ride, from one location to another.
where ride publishers can mention the time of departure, pickup location, drop location, seats available, ticket cost and other details.
A passenger can search the rides from the desired location to the destination. He will be able to see the time of departure, cost, pickup & drop point, map and other details.
Ride publishers and passengers both will be able to see the feedback and reviews of each other and can rate each other after the ride.
there will be an admin module to verify the profiles and manage complaints.
